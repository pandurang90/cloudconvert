## Contributing

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone down your fork (`git clone
   git://github.com/<username>/cloudconvert.git`).
3. Create a topic branch to contain your change (`git checkout -b
   my_awesome_feature`).
4. Hack away, add tests. Not necessarily in that order.
5. Make sure everything still passes by running `rake`.
6. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
7. Push the branch up (`git push origin my\_awesome\_feature`).
8. Create a pull request against pandurang90/cloudconvert and describe what
   your change does and the why you think it should be merged.
